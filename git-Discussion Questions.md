// Node.js single thread Nature increases the performance of O/P-bound tasks, but may struggle with CPU-intensive tasks also scalability is another tool that makes it easier to add more resources as needed

// The advantages of using event-driven architecture are efficient handling of concurrent connections and scalability and the disadvantages is the complexity and nested callbacks lead to code complexity

// Node.js non-blocking I/O model benefit we application benefit by allowing Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness. And the advantage for web application it makes it suitable for real-time web applications, such as chat apps, live updates, and streaming services.
