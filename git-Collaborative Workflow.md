// he purpose of creating pull request is to allow the developers to review and approve changes before merging them into the main codebase.

// he process of creating pull request is first create a branch, make changes, commit and push, then open a pull request on the repositoryâ€™s platform.

// The different between forking and cloning is that forking is creating a copy of a new repository in your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original works while cloning is copying a repository in your system, allowing you to work on the code. 

// Git collaborates with other developers by creating branching, commit and push and pull request.
