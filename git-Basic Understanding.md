// It uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O models which make efficient in handling multiple requests at a time.
// Node.js is lightweight, scalable making it suitable for real time applications and microservices

// relationship between Node.js and V8 engine; one V8 engine compile, optimize and execute JavaScript code also Node.js uses V8 engine to execute JavaScript code on server side

// a.	Fast and scalable
// b.	Event-driven and non-blocking
// c.	JavaScript can run but in back-end and front-end
// d.	JavaScript has many packages and modules 
// e.	Flexible and suitable for microservices and modern web development
