// Branching in Git helps a developer to work features independently, running a code without affecting the main code and collaboration with others.

// The different between merging and rebasing is merging is combining changes from one branch into another without preserving commit history while rebasing is clean, linear commit history and are working on a feature branch.

// Merging conflict occur when git canâ€™t automatically merge changes from two branches or changes made in the same file or line. 
// Conflict resolution step in git: 
// Identify the conflict, 
// manually resolve and 
// commit resolution.
